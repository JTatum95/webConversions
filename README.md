Simple command line tool to convert between units in web design (px, em, %, pt)

To install, download the files and make them executable. To make the files runnable from anywhere you can either drop them in your PATH or put them in the /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/sbin.

This is a simple project that I made mostly for myself, that is still in progress.

Known optimizations needed:
<ul>
<li>pxtables doesn't quite round properly</li>
<li>Little handling of user error</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>
